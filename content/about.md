Welcome to QiGe's personal website! I'm QiGe, the Founder of 登链区块链技术社区, and Co-Founder of ChangshaDAO and TryDAO, as well as the Founder of a lending protocol with a TVL of over 1 billion. I am also the author of *以太坊技术与实现*, a book dedicated to advancing blockchain technology.

I specialize in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract architecture design. My current focus includes:

- Developing blockchain-related algorithm books to help more people understand and apply this cutting-edge technology;
- Designing and creating blockchain technology training courses to cultivate more professionals for the blockchain community;
- Exploring and optimizing smart contract architecture to provide a solid foundation for future decentralized applications.

I firmly believe that blockchain technology will lead the next wave of business and technological transformation. That's why I remain committed to innovation and development in this field, striving to build an open, transparent, and trustworthy value network.

I also believe that AI is a tool for increasing productivity, while blockchain technology is a revolutionary force for changing generative relationships. How to effectively leverage blockchain technology to solve real-world problems is a question that blockchain believers must contemplate in the long term.
